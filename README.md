### Source of inspiration


I like the picture wall screensaver of the mac computer very much. The screen saver of the mac can be configured with a folder, and then the pictures will be displayed on the picture wall.

At the same time, there are some old Android devices at home, and I have always wanted to use these idle devices as electronic photo albums. 

I'm an Android engineer and I just wanted to combine these two ideas. So I made this app and called it `Showcase`.

In Showcase, you can configure the image source, which can be a local folder or some shared file protocols, such as SMB, FTP, SFTP, WebDav.

Of course I'm adding more support for network storage like Google Grive, OneDrive, DropBox...

In addition, I also added the movie poster data source TMDB, you can choose to display the posters of current or upcoming movies.

In the future, I will add more image source support, and even support for video. And add more styles to display pictures.
