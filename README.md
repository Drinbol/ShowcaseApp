## Overview

> ShowcaseApp is an elegant application designed to transform your devices into beautiful digital photo frames. Inspired by macOS's Picture Wall screensaver, this app displays your pictures in customizable, visually appealing layouts. You can customize the source of pictures. Now it supports FTP, SFTP, SMB, and Webdav protocols. You can also configure the style of picture display.

### üí° Source of inspiration
The idea for ShowcaseApp came from two main inspirations:

- The elegant Picture Wall screensaver on macOS that turns any folder of images into a beautiful visual display
- A desire to repurpose idle Android devices photo or pad as digital photo frames for displaying cherished memories

As an Android engineer, I wanted to combine these concepts into a single, polished application that would breathe new life into unused devices while creating an aesthetically pleasing way to enjoy photos.
